# React-optimizing-performance

### What is performance in an app?

Performance has to do with how fast or slows your app loads if the app crashes when it reaches a peak in user activity, and how smooth certain features (like payments) work. Think App says: “Performance is a product of multiple factors: the server, mobile device, network, and programming of the app itself.”
### How important is app performance?

Most (70%) of mobile app users will abandon an app if it takes too long to load. A one-second delay in response can result in a 7% loss in conversion, and nearly one in every two apps are uninstalled within the first month of download.

## How improve performance in React?

There are many factors https://www.codementor.io/blog/react-optimization-5wiwjnf9hj, among the most important we have:

-  Use React.Fragments to Avoid Additional HTML Element Wrappers
-  Avoid using Index as Key for map
-  Optimizing the components with React Memo
-  Optimizing the functions components with useCallback and useMemo
-  Use lazy load component
-  Use lazy load image
-  Delete unused code and imports

## what we will learn?

-  Optimizing the components with React Memo (branches: memo-problem, memo-solution)
-  Optimizing the functions components with useCallback and useMemo  (branches: useCallback-problem and useMemo-solution)
