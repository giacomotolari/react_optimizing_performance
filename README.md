# Props Exercise - Blog Page

## what's going on?

In App.jsx we have a blog web page with three "<section>" elements, each section is a post.
You can see that each section contain almost the same HTML.

## Task

Split the code in App.jsx and create **_only_** a single **_Post_** component.
This component can contain different HTML.

In App.jsx we can return only three Post components, the "div className="App"" container and the "h1" element.
Find the best way to do that.
