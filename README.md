## what's going on?

We have a data.json file containing an array of posts.
We want to use this array to create an iteration and display render each post component that takes data from each object.


## Task

Split the code in App.jsx and create **_only_** a single **_Post_** component.
This component can contain different HTML.

In App.jsx we can return only three Post components, the "div className="App"" container and the "h1" element.
Find the best way to do that.
