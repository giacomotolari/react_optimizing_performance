# Props Exercise - Blog Page

## what's going on?

In App.jsx we have a blog web page with three section-elements, each section is a ***post***.
You can see that each section contains almost the same HTML.

## Task

Split the code in App.jsx and create **_only_** a single **_Post_** component, which can contain different HTML.

In App.jsx we can return only three Post-components, the "div className="App"" container and the "h1" element.


Find the best way to do that.
